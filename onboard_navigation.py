Select a Vehicle from a list of existing vehicles (at least the three examples given in create_example_vehicles).

Select an origin and destination city from among all cities in worldcities_truncated.csv (any city must be selectable, including cities that have homonyms).

Find a shortest path between the two given cities, if there exists one.

If there is a path, create a map of the path, and exit. Otherwise, just exit.
